# Code-Notes
This is an Obsidian Vault that I use as my second brain or a store-house of all the information about technical topics that i come across and feel like retaining. Every file here is written in markdown for seamless readility right out of the box without needing obsidian. However for the most epic organised experience, Obsidian is highly recommende.
