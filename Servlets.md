#Concept 
A **Servlet** (short for "serverlet") is a Java-based program that runs on a web server and handles client requests, typically to generate dynamic web content. Servlets are part of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) platform and are used for building web applications and extending the functionality of web servers.

**Key Characteristics and Functions of Servlets:**

1. **Dynamic Web Content:** Servlets are primarily used to generate dynamic content on web pages. They can process client requests, perform business logic, and generate HTML, XML, JSON, or other types of responses.

2. **Platform Independence:** Servlets are written in Java, making them platform-independent. They can run on any web server that supports the Java Servlet API, which includes popular web servers like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and IBM WebSphere.

3. **Request-Response Model:** Servlets operate on a request-response model. When a client (typically a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a web server, the server forwards the request to the appropriate servlet, which processes it and sends an HTTP response back to the client.

4. **Lifecycle:** Servlets have a well-defined lifecycle that includes initialization, handling requests, and destruction. Developers can override specific methods to customize the behavior of a servlet at various stages of its life.

5. **HTTP Handling:** Servlets are commonly used to handle HTTP requests and responses. They can parse incoming request parameters, read headers, and set response headers, among other HTTP-related tasks.

6. **Session Management:** Servlets can manage user sessions by creating and maintaining session objects. This allows applications to track user-specific data and maintain state across multiple requests.

7. **Multithreading:** Web servers typically create multiple threads for handling incoming requests. Servlets need to be thread-safe, as multiple threads can execute the same servlet concurrently to process different client requests.

8. **Extensibility:** Servlets can be extended and customized to provide various functionalities, such as authentication, authorization, file uploading, and more.

Servlets are often used in conjunction with JavaServer Pages (JSP) to create dynamic web applications. 

>__JSP (Java Server Pages):__ are a mix of Java code with HTML or XML to create dynamic and reusable web components to build interactive webpages.
>- They offer an implicit set of objects such as request, response, session etc. that make interaction with servlets very simple.
>- They provide support for JSTL (JavaServerPages Standard Tag Library) that allows for iteration, conditional formatting etc inside HTML/XML.
