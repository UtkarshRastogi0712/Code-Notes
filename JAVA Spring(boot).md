### Introduction:

JAVA Spring is a framework used to build developing Java Enterprise Edition based applications, webapps, [servlets](Servlets), [REST APIs](RESTful%20APIs) and microservices. Java Spring Boot is a project under Java Spring that speeds up the process of building JAVA Spring based applications by using _Auto Configurations, Dependency management and reducing Boilerplate code_. Key aspects:

- __Dependency Injection:__ Loosely couple required _beans (objects)_ into other classes or objects to enable _easier testing and maintainability_ by reducing tight coupling of code. Dependencies can easily be created in preconfigured ways and injected to test the required operation without having to test a whole dependency tree for the same. 
- __MVC based architecture:__ Spring Framework uses a _Model - View - Controller_ based web module to build web applications by providing a structures approach to handling requests and RESTful API's.
- __Microservices:__ Spring Cloud has a huge support of libraries for building and deploying microservices. It also supports integration of Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and cloud deployment support.
- __Security:__ Spring has support for powerful authorization and authentication and role based access. This also allows to focus on building application logic without cross cutting concerns like security and logging.

#### Benefits of using Spring Boot:
- Easy dependency management using .pom file.
- Reducing the need of boilerplate code using annotations and through application.properties file.
- Embedded tomcat server for testing.
- Bean autoscan automatically registers all beans (components) created with no need of an external XML file for configuration.
